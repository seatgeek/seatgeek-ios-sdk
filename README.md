## Installation

#### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

>Xcode 16.2+ is required to build the SeatGeekSDK using Swift Package Manager.

## Step I

To integrate SeatGeekSDK into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/seatgeek/seatgeek-ios-sdk", from: "4.8.1")
    ]

SeatGeekSDK uses external dependencies. Here you can find a list of them along with versions. 

 - SnapKit '5.7.1'
 - SwiftOTP '3.0.0'
 - HTTPTypes '1.0.0'

SeatGeekSDK uses them as binary targets, so you won't see any of the external dependencies in your `Package.swift` description. 
>Your application can use these dependencies independently by importing them to your file. There is no need to add them separately.

## Step II
Next, you need to add SeatGeek authorisation credentials. Please reach out to your SeatGeek Enterprise client services representative to acquire it.
You will find a step-by-step plan on how to configure auth files in our documentation.
