/**
 * Ingestions bring PDFs of tickets external to the SeatGeek system into SeatGeek.
 * SGIngestion objects represent ingestions in either of two phases:
 *    - pre-server: local PDF files on device, uniquely identified by their clientFile. clientStatus
 *                  is anything other than SGIngestionClientStatusOnServer, and there is
 *                  no serverStatus.
 *    - on server:  the ingestion is queued on SeatGeek's server and obtained from the
 *                  /ingestions endpoint. clientStatus is SGIngestionClientStatusOnServer.
