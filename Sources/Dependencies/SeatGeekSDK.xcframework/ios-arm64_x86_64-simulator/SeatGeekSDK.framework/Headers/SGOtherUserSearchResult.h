/**
 * SGOtherUserSearchResult objects represent other SeatGeek users that were searched
 * for by the this user, for example because the user wants to transfer their tickets
 * to someone else.
 *
 * These search results can come from our server, or from the device (from the userâ€™s address
 * book, or a user entered phone/email string. If they come from the device,
 * -transferPerson still returns a SGTransferPerson object, but it's not a server object,
 * won't have an ID, and will return false from -isSeatGeekUser.
 *
 * These search result objects map to the rows in SGOtherUserSearchController.
